# lireddit-web

This is the frontend of a fullstack [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6ypD7qv3Z8) that creates a lightweight version of Reddit by [Ben Awad](https://github.com/benawad/). The UI has been changed from the tutorial.
<br><br>This project uses TypeScript, GraphQL, TypeGraphQL, Apollo, TypeORM, Next.JS and Chakra UI.
